# Document Persistence Fix - Soum_Confluence

## 🐛 Problem Identified
The original Soum_Confluence system had a critical issue where uploaded documents were not being saved persistently. Documents were stored only in memory and would be lost when the server restarted.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Persistent Data Storage**
- Added JSON file-based storage for both applications and documents
- Data is automatically saved to `data/applications.json` and `data/documents.json`
- Data persists across server restarts

### 2. **Enhanced Document Upload**
- Improved file upload handling with better error messages
- Added file size validation (10MB limit)
- Added file type validation
- Enhanced upload form with additional metadata fields

### 3. **New Features Added**
- **Document Categories**: General, Technical, User Guide, API Documentation, etc.
- **Document Tags**: Comma-separated tags for better organization
- **Document Descriptions**: Optional descriptions for uploaded documents
- **Document Deletion**: Ability to delete documents with confirmation
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and validation

### 4. **Improved User Experience**
- Loading states during upload
- Success/error notifications
- File validation before upload
- Better form validation

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Server-side (server.js)
```javascript
// Added persistent storage functions
const loadData = () => { /* Load from JSON files */ };
const saveData = (type) => { /* Save to JSON files */ };

// Enhanced upload endpoint with better error handling
app.post('/api/upload', upload.single('document'), (req, res) => {
  // Improved validation and error handling
  // Automatic data persistence
});

// New endpoints added
app.delete('/api/documents/:id', ...);  // Delete document
app.put('/api/documents/:id', ...);     // Update document metadata
app.get('/api/documents/search', ...);  // Search documents
app.get('/api/health', ...);            // Health check
```

### Client-side (app.js)
```javascript
// Enhanced upload handling
async function handleUpload(e) {
  // File validation
  // Loading states
  // Better error handling
  // Success notifications
}

// New functions added
function deleteDocument(docId) { /* Delete with confirmation */ }
function testDocumentPersistence() { /* Health check */ }
```

### Frontend (index.html)
```html
<!-- Enhanced upload form -->
<form id="upload-form" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" accept=".pdf,.doc,.docx,..." required>
  <textarea name="description" placeholder="Description..."></textarea>
  <select name="category">...</select>
  <input name="tags" placeholder="Tags...">
</form>
```

## 📁 File Structure

│   ├── applications.json   # Applications data
│   └── documents.json      # Documents metadata
├── public/
│   ├── uploads/            # Uploaded files

├── server.js              # Enhanced backend
└── .gitignore            # Excludes data/ directory
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. **Start the Server**
```bash
npm start
```

### 2. **Upload Documents**
1. Click "Upload Document" button
2. Select a file (max 10MB)
3. Choose associated application (optional)
4. Add description and tags
5. Select category
6. Click "Upload Document"

### 3. **Manage Documents**
- View all uploaded documents in the Documents section
- Download documents by clicking the download button
- Delete documents with confirmation
- Search documents by name, description, or tags

## 🔒 Data Persistence
- All data is automatically saved to JSON files
- Data persists across server restarts
- Uploaded files are stored in `public/uploads/`
- Document metadata is stored in `data/documents.json`

## 🧪 Testing
1. Upload a document
2. Restart the server
3. Check that the document is still available
4. Verify all metadata is preserved

## 📊 Health Check
Visit `/api/health` to check system status:
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "applications": 25,
  "documents": 3
}
```

## 🎯 Benefits
- ✅ Documents are now permanently saved
- ✅ Better user experience with validation
- ✅ Enhanced document organization
- ✅ Improved error handling
- ✅ Data persistence across restarts
- ✅ Better file management

## 🔄 Migration
The system automatically migrates from the old in-memory storage to the new persistent storage on first run. No manual migration is required.
